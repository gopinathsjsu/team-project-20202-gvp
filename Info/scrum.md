## Overview of Scrum

Scrum is an agile framework that helps teams manage and complete complex projects by working in iterative cycles called **Sprints** (usually 1-4 weeks long). Each Sprint includes planning, execution, review, and retrospective phases.

### **Scrum Roles in Your Team**
Since you have a small team of three, you can distribute the roles:
- **Scrum Master (Aarav or Vedant)** - Ensures the team follows Scrum principles, removes blockers.
- **Product Owner (Neel)** - Defines project requirements, prioritizes features.
- **Development Team (All three of you)** - Designs, codes, tests, and deploys the system.

## **High-Level Sprint Plan**
Since your project has multiple components (APIs, UI, database, deployment), you will likely need **4-5 sprints**, each lasting **1-2 weeks**.

### **Sprint 1: Project Setup & Initial Planning (Week 1)**
- Define key features & break them into user stories (Product Backlog).
- Set up GitHub repository, project board, and documentation (README).
- Define team roles & agree on Scrum workflow.
- Create initial database schema and mock data.
- Create UI wireframes for customer, manager, and admin roles.

### **Sprint 2: API Development & Database (Week 2-3)**
- Develop core APIs (Restaurant search, Booking, User Authentication).
- Implement input validation and error handling.
- Set up and test database integration with APIs.
- Deploy API on AWS with a basic setup.

### **Sprint 3: UI Development & API Integration (Week 4-5)**
- Develop customer UI (search, book, view bookings).
- Develop restaurant manager UI (manage listings).
- Connect UI to APIs.
- Test and refine API responses.

### **Sprint 4: Admin Panel & Finalizing Features (Week 6)**
- Develop Admin UI (approve/remove restaurants, analytics).
- Implement notification system (email/SMS confirmations).
- Conduct usability testing and bug fixes.

### **Sprint 5: Deployment, Testing, and Documentation (Week 7-8)**
- Optimize deployment (Auto-scaling EC2, load balancer).
- Perform integration & end-to-end testing.
- Document API endpoints and project features.
- Prepare for final demo.

## **How to Document Sprints**
Each sprint should include:
1. **Sprint Planning**: Define tasks and assign them in GitHub Issues or a Scrum board.
2. **Weekly Scrum Report**:
   - What tasks did I work on / complete?
   - What am I planning to work on next?
   - What tasks are blocked?
3. **Sprint Backlog**: Use a Google Sheet or Trello/JIRA to track progress.
4. **Burndown Chart**: Track the remaining work in a graph.
5. **Sprint Review & Retrospective**:
   - What went well?
   - What needs improvement?
   - What are the action items for the next sprint?
